Hi, this is Trak — a privacy-first way to track real engineering progress. Instead of screen time, Trak measures what actually changed in code, how long it took, and what quality risks remain.It's open source and built around three workflows: a CLI for session tracking, a developer dashboard for review, and optional team reporting — plus MCP so tools like Kiro can automate it.Here's the CLI. A developer can run Trak locally, start a session, code normally, and stop the session to generate a clean summary and quality signals. Org reporting is optional — if you don't log in, it stays local.This is the developer dashboard. Every session is listed with a quality score and issue counts, so you can immediately see which sessions need attention.When you open a session, you get the breakdown: duration, files changed, and the detected findings. You can filter issues by severity, review descriptions and suggested fixes, and see exactly which files were touched. This creates a lightweight audit trail of work — without recording your screen.And when something should be tracked, you can create a GitHub issue directly from a finding — turning analysis into an actionable task for the repo.If GitHub isn't configured, Trak fails safely and tells you what's missing — like a token — instead of silently breaking.Now for managers: the org dashboard aggregates session reports across developers. You can see total sessions, active developers, average quality, and total issues at a glance.And you can drill into a session to see what changed and why it matters — without collecting invasive data. The idea is visibility into delivery and risk, not surveillance.Finally, Trak integrates with Kiro via MCP. From Kiro CLI, Trak can start a session, track changes as work happens, fetch status, and stop the session to produce a summary and analysis. That means your AI-assisted workflow automatically generates traceable sessions and quality signals with almost zero manual effort.
